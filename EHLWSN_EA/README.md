# EHLWSN-EA

### I. Code description
The code consists of two parts: energy harvesting and energy allocation algorithm:
#### Energy allocation 
* **(1) FTF**: Fast Time Fair Energy Allocation algorithm. "Improving Power Stability of Energy Harvesting Devices With Edge Computing-Assisted Time Fair Energy Allocation," in IEEE Transactions on Green Communications and Networking, vol. 5 , no. 1, pp. 540-551, March 2021

* **(2) MAllEC**: implementation of Maximum Allowed Energy Consumption algorithm from "Mallec: Fast and optimal scheduling of energy consumption for energy harvesting devices," IEEE Internet of Things Journal, vol. 5, pp. 5132–5140, Dec 2018.

* **(3)Ours algorithm** : "EH-LWSN optimal energy allocation algorithm to maximize throughput over a finite-horizon time period."

  

  Attention: The implementation of algorithm (1)(2)refers to the source code [eh_python]([EnfangCui/ECFTF (github.com)](https://github.com/EnfangCui/ECFTF)) of Cui. 



#### Dataset
We collect datasets from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory  for two distinct renewable energy sources: solar and wind.	
We use data collected from February 1st–6th, 2023. .
